## Kabaros (Mozafar)

Part of **[nyala.dev](https://nyala.dev)**; a dev house based between Glasgow 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿, Khartoum 🇸🇩 and Melbourne 🇦🇺. Started with my childhood friend [@abolkog](https://github.com/kabaros), we do consultancy, build mobile and web apps (MVPs mainly) and use the income to build **tech _for_ the marginalised _by_ the marginalised**, and to give junior developers their first job in tech.

Some of our _#tech4good_ projects:

### barmaga.io
[barmaga.io](https://barmaga.io) is a platform to learn programming in Amharic 🇪🇹, Arabic 🇸🇩 and Swahili. These are languages spoken by ~400 million people with barely any content online. We hope to slowly change that. It's open-source open-content forever.

💰 Support us on [chuffed.org](https://chuffed.org/project/barmagaio) to keep the project going.
